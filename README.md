## 1.	Background
Tasty Bite Restaurant aims to optimize its menu offerings and operational efficiency to increase revenue and customer satisfaction. To achieve this, the restaurant needs to analyze its sales data to identify trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions. 
2.	Business Problem
By analyzing the sales dataset of Tasty Bite Restaurant, we can address the following keys questions:
1.	Most Ordered and Sold category: This analysis helps the restaurant understand customer preferences and focus on offerings that drive sales.
2.	Most Ordered and sold item: This insight allows the restaurant to prioritize menu items that are popular among customers and potentially optimize pricing or promotions for those items.
3.	Orders and Sales by week and Month: Analyze the trends in order and sales overtime, both on a weekly and monthly basis. This analysis helps identify seasonal variations, peak periods, and overall growth trends, allowing the restaurant to adjust staffing levels, inventory management and marketing efforts accordingly.
4.	Sales Peak Time: Determine the time of the day when sales peak occurs. Understanding the peak sales hours enables the restaurant to allocate resources effectively, such as scheduling staff members during busy hours.

## 3.	Data Wrangling
The raw data was imported into the Power Query Editor, which served as the initial stage for data preparation and cleansing. Within the Power Query Editor, various data cleaning processes were applied to enhance the quality and integrity of the dataset.
Firstly, missing values and duplicate records were identified and addressed appropriately, either by removing or imputing missing values, and eliminating duplicates to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
Additionally, data type mismatches were rectified by converting the data types to their correct formats, ensuring proper representation, and enabling accurate analysis.
After undergoing these comprehensive data cleaning steps, the dataset was thoroughly scrubbed, resulting in a refined and reliable dataset, ready for further analysis and exploration.
 
## 4.	Analysis and Findings
According to the dashboard, the most ordered category of dishes was Asian, accounting for 29% of total orders, followed by Italian and Mexican dishes at 24% each, and American dishes at 23%.
However, in terms of sales revenue, Italian dishes generated the highest portion at 31%, followed by Asian dishes at 29%, Mexican dishes at 22%, and American dishes at 18%.
This discrepancy between the order volume and sales revenue for Asian and Italian dishes could be attributed to pricing differences, with Italian dishes potentially commanding higher prices compared to Asian dishes.
Similarly, while the order volumes for Italian and Mexican dishes differed by only 3 orders, the sales revenue gap was significantly larger at approximately £14,666, suggesting that Mexican dishes were priced lower than Italian dishes.
An analysis of the top 10 most sold items revealed that the Korean beef bowl (an Asian dish) had the highest sales, followed by Spaghetti and Meatballs (an Italian dish), and Tofu Pad Thai (an Asian dish). The least sold items were Pork Ramen (Asian) and Chicken Parmesan (Italian).
In terms of monthly performance, Tasty Restaurant recorded substantial sales of £53,817 at the end of January. However, sales and orders declined in February, with sales dropping by 5.6% to £50,790 and orders decreasing by 6.2% from 4,104 to 3,851. In March, the restaurant experienced a sales rebound of 7.5% (£54,610) and a 7.6% increase in orders (4,142) compared to the previous months.
Further analysis is required to determine the reasons behind the sales and order fluctuations in February and the subsequent peak in March. Potential factors to consider include events, holidays, or promotional campaigns that may have influenced customer behaviour.
Additionally, the dashboard identified the peak time for food purchases to be between 11:47 AM and 3:00 PM, when most food items were ordered.
## 5.	Recommendation
To increase revenue and enhance customer satisfaction, Tasty Bite Restaurant should:
Continue to invest in Italian and Asian food offerings, as these categories demonstrated strong performance in terms of orders and sales revenue.
Reevaluate the pricing strategy for Mexican dishes. Since the order volume for Mexican dishes matched that of Italian dishes, a moderate price increase could be considered to potentially boost revenue from this category.
Prioritize and focus marketing efforts on the top 10 most sold food items. This could involve implementing targeted promotions or optimizing pricing strategies to further drive orders and sales for these high-performing menu items.
Enhance staffing levels during the peak afternoon hours between 11:47 AM and 3:00 PM. By ensuring adequate staffing during this period of high order volume, the restaurant can better meet customer demand and potentially increase sales.
These recommendations aim to capitalize on the restaurant's strengths, address potential areas for revenue growth, and improve operational efficiency to deliver a better customer experience and drive overall profitability.
